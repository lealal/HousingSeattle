# Housing Seattle

This is a learning exercise using the Keggle database for Seattle Price Prediction Housing. The goal was to use the Scikit-Learn library to create some models to predict housing prices in Seattle based on number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, and lot size.

The requirements file is included in case you would like to run the code locally
